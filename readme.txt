Present your content at its best on social sites and in search results, no matter how webpages are shared, re-shared, messaged, posted, embedded, or crawled.

== Description ==

<p><img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso/assets/icon-256x256.png"><strong>Present your content at its best on social sites and in search results, no matter how webpages are shared, re-shared, messaged, posted, embedded, or crawled:</strong></p>

WPSSO automatically creates meta tags and structured data markup for Facebook / Open Graph, Pinterest Rich Pins, Twitter Cards, Google Knowledge Graph, Google Rich Results (aka Schema, Rich Snippets, Structured Data), WhatsApp and Messaging Apps, Mobile Web Browsers, WordPress REST API, LinkedIn / oEmbed data and more &mdash; including markup for image SEO, video SEO, extensive e-Commerce product markup (for WooCommerce and others), mobile store apps, author profile / authorship, co-authors, publisher information, local business / local SEO, aggregate ratings, reviews, recipe information, event details, and much, much more &mdash; all from your existing content, supported plugin data, and service API data.

**Reads existing content, plugin data, and service API data:**

There's no need to manually re-enter descriptions, titles, product information, and re-select images / videos like other meta tag, SEO, or Schema plugins. WPSSO can be used as your only social and search optimization plugin, or combined Core with your favorite SEO plugin to improve your SEO plugin's meta tags and Schema markup (including All in One SEO Pack, Jetpack SEO Tools, Rank Math SEO, SEO Ultimate, SEOPress, The SEO Framework, WP Meta SEO, Yoast SEO, and more).

**Customize the settings for different languages:**

Text, image, and video related options are WordPress language / locale aware, which means you can easily switch languages and customize these options for different front-end webpage languages.

**Fast, light, and coded for maximum performance:**

WPSSO makes full use of all WordPress caching methods &mdash; along with advanced caching features like pre-seeding in background. WPSSO Core and its complementary add-ons load only the PHP libraries and classes they need, keeping their code small, fast and light. All code is fully tested and compatible with the latest version of WordPress and PHP v8.

<h3>Users Love the WPSSO Core Plugin</h3>

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "This plugin has been a lifesaver in terms of making our images and links and descriptions look beautiful everywhere we post them! Itâ€™s so easy to use and the preview functions are incredibly helpful." - [lotusblooms](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/love-this-plugin-789/)

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "What a fantastic plugin. If you want to fix all the errors in search console for structured data, this is the plugin to use. Love it." - [goviral](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/makes-schema-so-easy/)

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "This plugin saves me so much time, and it has really lifted my SERP rankings. Most of my keywords I now rank 1-3 position. I also noticed after about a week that my impressions have gone up at least 75%. I upgraded to the pro version which gave me even more options." - [playnstocks](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excellent-plugin-and-support-200/)

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "Yoast on steroids! As an SEO marketer, I love using Yoast for my basic on-page SEO. But Yoast only allows you to enter basic Open Graph social settings. This plugin gives you SO many more options on completing the Open Graph for Facebook, Twitter cards, Pinterest etc. If you use WordPress, I totally recommend using this plugin to help with better rankings in the SERPS!" - [gregmontag](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/yoast-on-steroids/)
